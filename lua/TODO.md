- [ ] `<C-x><C-h>` for history completion
	- using cmp was problematic with multiple lines
	- use old school fzf as before for now
- [ ] markdown code block
	- [ ] i`<Tab>
	- [ ] V`
- [ ] markdown inline code with ve`
- [ ] <leader>wg
	- should [w]eb [g]oogle
		- the word under cursor
		- the visual selection
	- replace [W]orkspace (which-key)
- `cmp.setup.cmdline` with less completions (but not the global `vim.opt.pumheight`)
- [ ] map `<leader>gg` to `[G]oto [G]oogle` for word under cursor (visual too)
	- prior art: https://superuser.com/questions/211989/is-there-a-vim-plugin-that-lets-you-google-the-selected-text
	- but a good excuse to learn some lua scripting ;)
